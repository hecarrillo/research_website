When you undertake you will \n              have to face many adversities and no matter how much they hit you, if you \n              really trust your skills you must continue fighting for your future. \n              In addition to the hard work that the series demonstrates, another great \n              principle in the world of entrepreneurship is trust. There are many cases \n              in which entrepreneurs have lost their idea or product at the hands of more \n              powerful entrepreneurs. That is why trust becomes a principle, plus the \n              ability to detect someone with bad intentions must improve over the years.</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      </main>\n      <Footer />\n    </>\n  );\n}\nexport default Findings;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
