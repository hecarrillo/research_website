Today this topic is highly requested by all people, although most of them are young. Questions like: what do I need to undertake? Do I need a lot of knowledge to undertake? Can everyone undertake?

This is the main differentiator of people who take the step to entrepreneurship and those who only have a lot of ideas at the head and do not carry them out. Entrepreneurship ranges from selling candy at your school, to creating a processor capable of beating all the competition and offering it to multi-million dollar companies. According to the RAE the term undertake is defined as: to undertake and start a work, a business, an endeavor, especially if they contain difficulty or danger.
